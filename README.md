# arcaea_map
A simple repo that contains .json files, which is used for Lost's Arcaea-server repo (https://github.com/Lost-MSth/Arcaea-server).

Note that all of the maps are still in development, and is not stable / finished yet. Also, all of the maps are based on the wiki and official server, so there could be mistakes or errors. Please make an issue report if necessary. However, some features are hardcoded, thus making impossible to fix the problem. Others are just due to my laziness and carelessness.
